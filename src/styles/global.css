/**
 * Global Styles
 *
 * This file is the entry point for all Tailwind CSS styles in our app.
 * NativeWind processes this file and makes all Tailwind utilities available
 * for use with the className prop in React Native components.
 *
 * THE THREE DIRECTIVES:
 * 1. @tailwind base: Resets and base element styles (normalized defaults)
 * 2. @tailwind components: Component classes (like .btn, .card - we'll add custom ones)
 * 3. @tailwind utilities: All utility classes (bg-*, text-*, p-*, etc.)
 *
 * WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:
 * CSS specificity flows from least to most specific:
 * base < components < utilities
 * This allows utilities to override component styles when needed.
